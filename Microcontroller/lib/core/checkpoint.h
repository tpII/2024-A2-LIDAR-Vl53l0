 * This library was intended to implement a checkpoint mechanism to 
 * abort execution safely, release resources, and reset semaphores. 
 * However, it remains incomplete and is not fully functional.
 * 
 * WARNING: This library is a work in progress and does not currently 
 * ensure a complete rollback or proper system recovery.
